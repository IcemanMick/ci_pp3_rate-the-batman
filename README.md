## Introduction

### Background
Rate The Batman is a simple survey website built using the Python programming language.

Users provide their ratings in the terminal. These ratings are recorded on a dedicated Google Sheet and from here the following are calculated and returned to the user's terminal:
- User's score of The Batman
- User's percentage rating of the Batman
- The average percentage rating of previous survey users.

As The Batman is a movie currently in cinemas at the time of this surveys creation, it was topical to use The Batman as the theme of the survey.

The purpose of the website is to have people who have seen "The Batman" provide their ratings. Users will rate the performances of three of the main characters (Batman, Catwoman, and The Riddler), three of the supporting characters (Alfred, The Penguin, and Jim Gordon), and three of the production values (Visuals, Costume Design, and Music) between 1 and 10.

For the characters, the nature of what the users are rating is left deliberately ambigious and subjective to the user. The user is not told if they are to rate the actor's/actress's performance, or the portrayal of a character, or whether they enjoyed a character or not. They are simply asked to rate the character basedon the character's name. This is to remove any biases the user may have towards an actor or actress.

For the production values, it is assumed that the higher the rating, the greater the enjoyment or quality.
